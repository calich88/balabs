Dorothoong Lis,,Couples,6 contributions,2022,10,1,0,1,10/1/2022,Super,"Follow many recommendations, we booked the trip to Carang floating market, chocolate factory, fruit garden and rural villages. The floating market are so amusing for us with tons of fruits on each boat. It opens wholeday but peak hour from 6.30 am til 8 am. Our guide are so knowlegeable and generous, he discussed with us any fields of Vietnam economy politics history and also invited us a very good coffee and noodle soup for breakfast (all are perfect). This experience is really authentic and unforgettable. Contact him on whatsapp +84936427369",5,2,tripadvisor_CaiRang_Merged.csv

It was small with only around 25 boats, mainly selling fruit, with very little atmosphere. It very much felt like it was dying. There were more tourist boats than merchants, and the river was filthy with rubbish. Unless they find a way to cater to the tourists (like they have done in Thailand), it will die out.  I would recommend giving it a miss.",1,0,tripadvisor_CaiRang_Merged.csv
Ian P,UK,unknown,"Cambridge, UK488 contributions",2020,2,1,488,0,2/1/2020,Not as good as anticipated,"I was really looking forward to visiting the market, having seen this on the TV many times. Sadly it didn't live up to expectations. Our guide was telling us the number of boats has dropped drastically in recent years. Sadly it is more of a tourist attraction now. There are more boats carrying tourists than there are sellers. I did find it interesting the boats with the different wares for sale. Sadly as others have mentioned there is a huge amount of rubbish in the Mekong which is a sad sight.",3,1,tripadvisor_CaiRang_Merged.csv

Many other boats too, but was relaxing and beautiful to watch the sunrise. The market was a few boats with produce and few other boats seeling sodas.  Enjoyed the boat ride and river, however the actual market is so so.",4,2,tripadvisor_CaiRang_Merged.csv

Rating the market as average does not mean it is average all the time. Just don't expect better than average during Tet (lunar new year).

1dancing_fool,,Couples,"Connecticut1,349 contributions",2013,9,1,1349,13,9/1/2013,Tips to best see the Markets and get the most out of your Boat Trip,"This review is for not only Cai Rang but also for the entire boat trip one can take out of Can Tho. Let me begin by saying this should be the number 1 attraction in Can Tho, but I assume most people are coming here to see this anyhow so TA's ranking is rather irrelevant. Also this will be helpful for those booking their own boat instead of taking a package tour down to Can Tho.There are basically two decisions you need to make for your boat trip:First, do you want a larger boat or a smaller boat? The typical smaller boat will have a motor but also be rowed as well to get into the thick of things. It will have a retractable awning for sun and rain cover as well. The larger boat will have a louder motor, have rows of bench seating, and be less mobile. The size of the boat is important for multiple reasons, and I'd suggest the smaller boat. First, if you want to also do the canals, the larger boats can't get down the idyllic smaller canals. Second, the smaller boats are rented to just you and your group instead of being put on a boat full of other people; this allows for more freedom of movement, better viewing & photo opportunities, and a more peaceful experience, especially when the motor is cut and you are just rowing. Third, the smaller boats can navigate the very busy markets easier, getting you in closer to the other boats, and, if you do the second smaller market, right into the thick of things, bumping into the maze of the other boats selling their wares. Fourth, the time of departure is up to you; we left at 5 a.m. to get the sunrise and be at the first market while it was in full swing. Second, do you want the short ( +/-3 hr ) or the long ( =/- 6 hr ) tour? We took the longer tour, which ended up being 7+ hours and was somewhat customized to our desire, and included both the large wholesale as well as the small retail market, a Cao Dia temple which we visited off of a river bank ( a highlight! we had the entire temple to ourselves and got to explore all of it, including climbing to the top and walking around the catwalk to get an excellent view of the river ), extra time in the small winding canals, no factory stop, and lunch of our choosing). I'm not sure of the itinerary of the smaller tour but do know it only goes to one market. I feel as though if you have come all the way down to Can Tho, do the longer tour. Besides, the smaller market is more interesting, IMO.You can book the tours everywhere; hotels, agencies, or in person. At the riverfront, there is a booking stand that sells the larger boat tours. Or, you can individually negotiate with the boats women direct. I wanted to have a guide because they add interesting background and perspective, and for a trip of 7 hours this is welcome. Being quite affordable, it seemed like the way to go. We booked SEn, who I read great reviews about here on TA. You can read my review of her and our trip here:http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g293927-i10140-k6881922-SEn_Tour_Guide_Review_for_Floating_Markets-Mekong_Delta.htmlI left at 5 a.m. to see the sunrise over the river as well as for the markets- the wholesale one is busiest very early and the retail will be over my mid/late morning I am told. Again, you spent all this time and effort to get down to Can Tho, might as well maximize the trip right? Skip the hotel breakfast, and get one on the water. We had pork & noodles from a local seller, which was arguably the best breakfast of our three week trip. I would encourage anyone independently traveling down too Can Tho for the markets to read my forum post linked above. It is very cheap and easy to get there from HCM on an express bus, and having a local guide for the boat tour is so much better than going it alone. So, to sum up:Take the Express bus from HCM > CT. Hire a small boat for the long tour. And contact SEn!",5,2,tripadvisor_CaiRang_Merged.csv
Fit F,,Couples,2 contributions,2020,3,1,0,0,3/1/2020,CAN THO FLOATING MARKET,"We booked a tour with Miss Loan and it was really good. I found her contact on the Tripadvisor and called her( 0908455718). In 5 minutes she got to the bar where we were and we talked about the tour. She organised the morning pick up service to our hotel and we went on a bout with her. She knows the river very well. We did the canals, floating market and the noodle factory where we had some noodle breakfast. On the way back she had some fruit for us. During the trip she was making some bamboo leaves decorations for us.Lovely and friendly lady. With the little English she knows, she does incredible job! Highly recommended!",5,2,tripadvisor_CaiRang_Merged.csv
