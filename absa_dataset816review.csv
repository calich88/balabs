1,"This hotel was introduced by a friend as the best hotel in the area, but I was a little disappointed after checking in. First of all, I arrived in the morning. The hotel did not allow early check-in on the grounds that there was no vacant room. When I returned to the hotel to check in at 6:30 in the afternoon Because I wanted a non-smoking room, check-in was delayed for at least half an hour. In the end, I got a twin room. In the apartment building, the air conditioner was very noisy, and the curtains in the room did not have sunshade function. Doesn't match..."

4,"This is the second time I choose to stay at Becamex Hotel New City, but my experience this time was really bad. At noon on the day I checked in, I arrived first, so I checked in first and informed the hotel reception that my friend would come in the evening. In the morning of the first day, we had breakfast together at the hotel restaurant, my friend was the one holding the room card to check the counter, the staff told the room there was only one guest, then they checked to confirm there were two. guest. See it as a temporary mistake that should have been fixed. On the second day, I had a meal and had the same situation. Why don't you double check the information?

The rules are too strict and strict with customers such an extremely bad experience when coming to Binh Duong from now on I will never use these hotels. BECAMEX related services too!!"

The hotel has staffs holding umbrellas in the parking lot, but there are still many hotel staff who just stand there holding umbrellas and do not help cover the rain for our company's employees.

From the above story:
1. Lessons on customer experience in today's business.

To work like that is to be said to be uneducated. Rate 1 star so you guys know how to work next time not like that again."

Although I walked into the hotel, I felt that the service was okay. But a short unpleasant experience. Just made me feel bad. Otherwise, it must be five stars today, but the hotel is still good.

214,"It is the largest of the nearby hotels. However, the reception has not improved at all, so curses come out naturally. Be sure to check as the payment terms are different between reservation and check-in. It's not once or twice that I grabbed my back before checking into the room. If you can afford it, use the Thu Dau Mot branch of the same hotel."

222,"Good menu, reasonable prices. Location food for business"
223,"The location is a bit inconvenient as it is an hour away from downtown Ho Chi Minh, but the hotel itself is good value for money. The residence building and the hotel building are divided, and the residence building is cheaper... Still, the hotel building has better internal facilities."
224,"My first time coming to this place! Take a survey to prepare for an upcoming event for guests! - Convenient location: Located on a large, open road, parking is comfortable! - The reception area is open, there are many trees when entering, it is very pleasant. - Step upstairs, until the Foyer area welcomes guests, there is also a very nice place to take pictures! - The next step into the conference room is very large, according to my observations, it can accommodate more than 1000 guests. - The toilet area is clean and fragrant, that feeling is too ok. Almost all events in Binh Duong are held here! Wish Becamex Hotel New City more success!"

230,I think the facility is well managed. It's clean.
231,"Overall it's good, but the toilet doesn't flush well"
232,"The planning of the neighborhood is very good, very American style, the roads are big and the sidewalks are big, the houses are set back, it feels very quiet, but it is still a rural place XDD, but the consumption is not in the countryside. The hotel itself is very high-end, with an infinity pool. Gym, steam room, and very high-end (consumption) restaurants cost about 100,000 to 200,000. The point is that they are still delicious, so they are acceptable. It can be called an oasis in the desert."

237,It is a clean room with simple and sufficient facilities. There is a food court and Family Mart nearby.
238,"The air conditioner was terrible, from the time I called the front desk at 10pm to complain, and ended up being offered a different room, it took an hour and was inefficient. It's so late, don't you think about the guests?"
239,"The environment is elegant, the service is considerate, and the sister at the front desk speaks Chinese very fluently"

245,The service is very good!
246,Peripheral facilities are not very good for business
247,"There are many restaurants nearby but there is nothing to go shopping. The advantage is that it is very quiet, the breakfast is very good, the room is big and clean, but I don’t know why the air conditioner is not cold"

261,"Clean, cool, beautiful, attentive and polite service staff"
262,The food menu was plentiful and delicious. I would like to improve the mounting position of the toilet paper. I had a good time overall.
263,"Very good breakfast selection, egg dishes such as omelettes are prepared live, but the coffee took some getting used to, very clean room, comfortable bed, very good WiFi, friendly staff, maybe replace the air conditioning filter for better room air"
264,"Every time I come to Binh Duong Province, Vietnam, I will definitely stay in a hotel. Probably one of the best hotels in the area."
265,"This is a place to stay for business travelers in Binh Duong New City, not suitable for tourists, because it is very far from Thu Dau Mot center."
266,"I was attending a conference at the conference centre next to the apartment hotel hence convenient place to stay. It is about 17 kms (about one hour) from Ho Chi Minh City airport. Check-in/out was efficient. Nice and spacious lobby. One bedroom suite was comfortable however very strong smoking smell in the room. Bathroom and toilet was spacious. Self catering facilities available in the room. Bed was comfortable. 

There are no interesting places to visit in the vicinity of the hotel. Wide tree-lined streets and newly constructed buildings nearby however for those who would like to dine in restaurants, shopping or enjoy some entertainment, the downtown area is about 20 minutes by taxi. 

Buffet breakfast was quite extensive and good. Restaurant serves quite decent pho."

272,"It's a clean and friendly hotel, but it's getting more and more expensive. Breakfast is good, you can exercise, gym, sauna, swimming, and it's close to the golf course, so it's a designated hotel for women's golf in Korea. Shampoo and soap products aren't good, so it's better to bring your own. There are a few convenience stores and restaurants nearby. It's okay to eat outside sometimes, and there's a Korean restaurant, Arirang."
273,"Breakfast is delicious and so does coffee. Room is clean. Very peaceful environment. Staff there are always smile and ready to provide customer the service. Definitely, it is the best hotel in this area."
274,The best hotel in Binh Duong province!
275,"quiet place.
the breakfast"
276,"This hotel is good for attending a meeting at the next door Binh Duong conference centre or for other work related purpose. I cannot imagine anyone to stay in the fairly empty Becamex New City for any other reason. (As if the planners did not learn anything from the 20th century: you are supposed to design cities for people, not for cars!) The hotel is very big and divided into hotel rooms and apartments, while the restaurant, a gym and a great outdoor pool are in the middle. For an unknown reason I got the apartment. It was clean, but quite sparse and not a great design. My colleague got a hotel room which looked comfortable. The restaurant was ok. I particularly liked the gym and the pool. The service was kind and attentive."

287,"This Becamex hotel is located at Binh Duong, the ‘new city’.  I stayed here for 2 night attending Horasis Asia conference, staying at their ‘suite room’. 
The room has reasonably good size, but layout can be better.  Bed was comfortable, sheets and towels were clean but not as ‘fresh’. 
Food selections during breakfast was pretty good, especially their Beef Pho was tasty. But fresh fruits selections and quality were not that good. 
It’s pretty good hotel to stay only if you are attending conference at the convention center next to the hotel."
288,"Large hotel, large car park often treats large wedding parties. Good food, very good party service"

The breakfast is rich, and the room is similar to a business hotel in China, clean and tidy. Recommended. Great pool, nice gym."
303,"Very suitable for business travelers who have business to do in the area north of Saigon. However, there is very little going on in the evening and the dining options outside the hotel are limited to a food court with about 8 small restaurants, mainly Asian. A larger sushi restaurant is also in If you need more action you should look for something closer in HCMC or just take a taxi there (you have to calculate at least 1 hour drive depending on the destination in HCMC).
Breakfast is great, in addition to the full Asian breakfast program, it also has western things like toast and cornflakes. The coffee is very good, both in the restaurant and in the hotel's coffee bar.
Rooms are good, roughly on a European 4-star level, the slightly more expensive suites have in-room Wi-Fi with a slightly better connection. The standard WiFi network is not always very stable.

Only draw back is, there is nothing around the hotel to do in the evenings except a walk to food court just across. No malls or pubs etc around at a walking or small cab fare around. But if it a working business trip it’s a decent stay.
Nothing to complain about. It’s was fine."

The hotel is located next to the Binh Duong Provincial Government Building, which is suitable for business people to visit customers in industrial areas. The hot water is not very hot and the hair dryer doesn't work in the bathroom. The pillows are moderately soft and hard, and the mattress is comfortable and good for sleeping.

442,It is said that the environment is good and the price is right
443,Big new hotel.  Kind of sterile in there.
444,"comfortable, clean, good"
445,"The best hotel in the area with really good services and facilities. Located at the center of the New City - Thu Dau Mot, convenient to go anywhere around, day or night. The Eit's Cafe has the best cake selections in town and variety of coffee choices. The newly opened Tastes Restaurant has amazing ambience, tasty food with reasonable prices. The beautiful swimming pool is really a highlight of the place, although it's only for in-house guests. You can enjoy the view of all these by just having breakfast outdoor at 150k VND/pax though. The staff is really friendly. And the place is all run by solar power. What a sustainable hotel!"
446,A bit far from city center.
447,The breakfast is very rich…
448,"There are many choices for breakfast, the food is clean, fresh and delicious. The location of the hotel is good, suitable for bringing children, and there is a parking lot."

459,as good as before
460,"Clean, good service"
461,"The breakfast is very rich, the swimming pool is also big, and the room is very clean. The location of the hotel is a bit out of the way, but it is very convenient to have a restaurant nearby. It takes a few minutes to walk. The only downside is that check-in and check-out are too slow, the waiter can't speak Chinese, and the service attitude is average."
462,"The room is spacious, clean and nice. There is nothing around, so if there is a convenience store in the hotel like in Japan, it would be 100 points."
463,"The bedding and pillows have an odor, which bothers me. I put a towel on the pillow and used it, but it still smells like aging, so I want you to do something about it."
464,My boss in Taiwan let me book this hotel every time I go to Ho Chi Minh. It should be very good. The price is very favorable. It is much cheaper than booking in Taiwan. The Ctrip package breakfast is only 52 yuan. Taiwan does not include breakfast and it costs more than 600
465,"Cheap price, nice space"
466,"Very good hotel. Good wi-fi, clean and spacious rooms. Swimming pool, gym and restaurant. Staff was very professional and friendly.  Most spoke English.  Location is also very good in new part of town. Rates are very good. I will come back again."
467,It's great to have a store like this in Xincheng
468,"There are Chinese services, I can only guess some of them"
469,the best choice in Binh Duong
470,"It's clean and the staff are friendly and nice. It's built in a new town, so the surroundings are empty, but other than that, I'm satisfied overall."
471,"cost-effective, clean"
472,There is a large hall to hold a large party
473,"Clean room, comfortable restaurant, large swimming pool"
474,Nice hotel. The minute you go out you understand that you are in the middle of nowhere.  Nice for a day or two but you will go crazy if you stay there more than that.
475,"We were given welcome fruit and some wine. Great breakfast. There are many kinds, and you can usually choose what you like. Some of the staff, including the front desk, can speak English, so there is no need to worry. Shower is fine. The room was clean and well maintained. Nearby food courts, restaurants (recommended by Sushi Bar), and shops are convenient. Recently, a full-fledged handmade soba restaurant has opened a short distance away. The manager is Japanese, and the staff are fluent in Japanese."
476,"From the outside looking in, it looks good"
477,"I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past few years. The equipment is not bad, and the hotel breakfast is not bad, but it will be annoying if it is the same every day. Everything else is okay"
478,clean environment
479,"Modern, comfortable hotel, suitable for a future city center"
480,"Nice decorated hotel, good for those need to stay nearby"
481,No English television programming and the wfi was not reliable
482,"I went to the hotel restaurant, and the staff are really friendly. Becamex Hotel is new, so it's clean and has a good atmosphere. I'll stop by again next time I'm empty ."
483,A very good hotel with clean environment within a new township. Hope that it can be maintained well. Surrounding also has restaurant and convenient stores which is a plus. Not crowded nor with heavy traffic so walking to these places are just easy and safe.
484,"Good service, polite, professional staff"
485,"This is the best hotel in the area. I have always stayed at this hotel during my six business trips. It can be said that it is perfect for a business hotel. Security, cleanliness, fixtures, facilities, and services are all satisfactory. The burgers are especially delicious at the restaurant. There was only one case where the lock on the front door was broken, but the hotel's response was not bad. If there was a downside, the price went up every time I visited. Compared to two years ago, it has almost doubled. but it's still cheap"
486,Pretty. A bit far from the center
487,First choice when coming to Binh Duong
488,Beautiful standard hotel suitable for businessmen in the new city area
489,nice view
490,Nice environment
491,"Poor service at the front desk, slow check-in and check-out,"
492,"The price we booked for this room was already $8xx for a double room, and then we looked at the website for a sudden price reduction.
The room is clean as a whole, but told the staff that the bathroom leaked to the bed, they were completely irresponsible and ignored.
And the hotel is very noisy Chinese traveler, if you don't want to meet them, I would not recommend it to you. "
493,"I stayed here for the first time because the Mira hotel was full, but I can enjoy the resort feeling. The building was new, and the toilet was equipped with a washlet, so I was able to spend a comfortable time."
494,Internet speeds need to be improved on laptops.
495,Good
496,"It's just a hotel. Instead, it was nice that the air conditioner was great."
497,Nice hotel. Limited food menu. Courteous staff.
498,Finally the breakfast area is moved to a proper restaurant next to the pool instead of using the walkway of the hotel lobby. Well done!
499,"Breakfast, service, room are very satisfactory"
500,"Rich breakfast, big room"
501,It's classy.
502,"It's so nice to swim with the kids and make them eat.
The accommodation is so clean and the atmosphere of the cafe on the 1st floor is good.
I don't know how many visits."
503,"Nice environment, great swimming pool"
504,"Room is spacious, clean, quiet. Food ok. Staff is very cute. The surroundings are a bit deserted, but near many Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese restaurants, family mart, Hanh Nguyen cafe, food court... at lunch and dinner, it's only a 5-minute walk. If you want to go to TDM center, it's very convenient to use Becamex Tokyu's bus"
505,"The breakfast is great, the taste is okay, but there are a little less seats"
506,"I went to the hotel restaurant, and the staff are really friendly. Becamex Hotel is new, so it's clean and has a good atmosphere. I'll stop by again next time I go empty "
507,"It's all new and rooms are big and clean. 
There were a lot of design flaws that they need to weed out. One was the table and the chair. I had 2 chairs with a table in my room, perfect for my computer, I thought at first. But the table had a very big drawer underneath, so my legs could not get under the table. Even with the chair in the lowest position, it was not possible to sit at the table and work. 
The light switches took a lot of getting used to. Normally when you put the room card in the holder, the lights will turn on. Here i had to not just torn on the light, but first turn it off and then on, before the lights went on. It turned off in the bathroom automatically, which is good for power saving. But it would be more logical to just push the light switch once, to turn the light back on. 
Not much to choose from in the restaurant, it was also mostly empty. Only some sandwiches, if you wanted Vietnamese food, you had to ask for the additional menu. 
Quite in the middle of nowhere. but good if you are in the industrial area. Really nothing happening around the hotel, except from a few restaurants and luckily a family mart. 
Funny thing at the pool. They don't have a lifeguard, but they have staff all the time, to make sure you sign your name on a paper, before you use the pool. It's a really nice pool, but they had a party one day at the pool, and there was loud music and drunk people, when i just wanted a quiet swim."
508,Very good as always.
509,"Great price, service and amenities"
510,"Top of the line service, cleanliness, friendliness, staff speaks Engish. This hotel is more like a resort without the cost."
511,"Elegant environment, good law and order, there are Chinese restaurants and Vietnamese restaurants nearby,"
512,Good breakfast and convenient parking
513,It was clean and kind.
514,"very good service, excellent breakfast buffet, pool and fitness center open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
However, the hotel is located in the still sparsely populated New City of Thu Dau Mot."
515,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 weeks last summer and had a long term rate, which was okay. Now I had to stay for a couple of nights only, hence I didn't get the long term rate. the hotel is well equipped, Staff is friendly, but the location is simply boring, it is located in a new industrial zone with nothing else but new factories and a lot of empty land. 
The served breakfast is rich and they also offer half board or full board accomodation."
516,"I came to stay for the weekend, the swimming pool is good, the hotel is beautiful, the rooms are great, there is a central park next to it is also very beautiful."
517,Room is spacious. There is a bedroom and a kitchen. Good view.
518,Beautiful and spacious space
519,"Booked for a friend, very satisfied."
520,"Stayed alone in this hotel for 3 different nights to get some good rest from hard working day. Clean, great service, nice people, but no swimming pool or gym even outside nearby was very disappointing for me. Still, it's good to have time to refresh. Used three different rooms, two with nice and decent views, but one bedroom was terrible with noise from the neighbor's living room."
521,"Generally speaking, it is a good hotel in the local area. The breakfast is good and the location is not bad. I booked for 3 days and 2 nights and gave me the best price. I like it."
522,"It's pretty good, clean and tidy, safe, and the staff are very nice, except that the checkout is a little slow, and the neighborhood is not lively. But for me, not being lively is not a shortcoming, I don’t like being noisy"
523,No shops of leisure around.
524,Environmental friendly
525,#The best hotel in Binh Duong New Town#Convenient Accommodation#Reasonable breakfast
526,The pool was stunning
527,"Becamex Hotel, the hotel is spacious and airy, but here the wifi network is not very good."
528,"It looks high-end, but it’s actually okay, it’s not good for cooking"
529,The service experience is too poor and the staff is not good. View is fine.
530,So beautiful - quiet - luxurious
531,"I used it for two weeks on my first business trip to Vietnam. Room cleaning was always perfect. The welcome fruit was delicious. During my stay, I chose salad, ham, cheese, fruit, bread, and Vietnamese coffee from the buffet every day. For dinner, we used the nearby hikari food court, Shushi Bar Japanese food, and a Korean restaurant in a building a little away, and we were all very satisfied. A Panasonic dryer was always available. Amenities were sufficient."
532,"Professional, beautiful "
533,"Safe, quiet and clean"
534,"The hotel's hardware facilities are good, the breakfast is okay, the room is clean and comfortable, and there is a big swimming pool, which is very good. Just take a taxi and navigate to the wrong gate. The disadvantage is that the check-in and check-out efficiency is extremely low, I hope it can be improved…"
535,"I stayed in an apartment-style accommodation for about a week in early December. The room was clean at first, but I didn't feel that it was clean because they emptied the trash once every two days or set the bedspreads again without changing them. There is one convenience store, but since it's in a new town, there's nothing around. And at 12:00 at night, I couldn't sleep because I turned on the machine that made a very loud noise to disinfect outside, so when I went out, it was all documented and said that it was at this time. They said it was guided and kept disinfecting. The breakfast wasn't bad."
536,"Everything was first class and would highly recommend it.
It was very hot, thats all I can say but thats out of anyones control"
537,This hotel is very remote and desolate. The hotel staff discriminates against Chinese people. The service attitude is extremely poor and rigid! I don't know why Ctrip recommends this kind of hotel to Chinese people!
538,I really like this hotel. It is probably the most cost-effective hotel I have stayed in recently.
539,"It is the best choice among all the options in the region, clean facilities and well trained staffs. Decent quality cafe! I love their gym, pool and breakfast."

556,The environment is average.
557,"The location of this hotel is okay, the service is really nothing to say, we have a group of 6 people staying here for 5 consecutive days, it is difficult to deal with it for one more night, the front desk staff really don't know how to adapt of. Difficult to communicate."
558,"The environment is very good, I will choose this hotel again if I have the opportunity"
559,"Pros:- best hotel in Binh Duong Area
Ideal choice for business.
Cons:- over-crowding at breakfast, they should open up the other restaurant at the pool soon to accomdate more guests. 
Suggestions :- Self service laundry room?"
560,"The design and environment of the hotel is excellent.   Bright, ego friendly feel, clean rooms and contemporary.  Good reception and good breakfast.   I would like to stay in this hotel again next trip.
The drainage in the shower cabin has to be improved.   Water came out from the cabin to the bathroom."
561,"The room is spacious and fine. The staff is friendly and the live band in the lobby lounge can really sing.  However, I'm here on business and the hotel internet reminds me of dial up 2G. Please upgrade your internet connection if you want business customers."
562,"Foods options seem to increase comparing to last year.
Great location for the factories nearby."
563,nice breakfast
564,The room facilities are top-notch! It's a pity that it's a bit out of the way! !

571,Very nice and comfortable hotel
572,The best hotel in the smart city
573,"Clean, but the price went up after the promotion"
574,"I stay in an apartment next to the main building. 1. There is no reading light in the bedroom. Turn off the light, walk and lie down. 2. The sofa is uncomfortable. 3. There is no TV in the bedroom. 4. The building is new. 5. The quality of amenities is poor. 6. There are two air conditioners, but there is only one remote control. 7. The windows are not soundproof. 8. It is a relatively remote place. There are restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores within 5-10 minutes on foot."
575,"The breakfast is good, but the surrounding area is not so good and not very convenient!"
576,"It may be because of the new hotel, the smell is too strong! dislike"

Limited menu options"

589,"The buffet is quite rich, and we can still eat many things we are used to, but the hotel's Vietnamese noodle soup is really not flattering, and it is far worse than the Vietnamese street food stalls, which makes me very sorry."
590,Breakfast is average!
591,"The front desk clerk was unfriendly, and started to say that there was no room. I immediately booked on Ctrip, and the booking was successful. Later, I said that the room would take 20 minutes to be ready. Finally, we waited for a while, and another waiter gave me the room card. Feeling played."
592,"Breakfast was very good except for one small thing, that there was no yoghurt or quark food. Apartment room very spacious with its own kitchen, but no cutlery and cooking pots available. Microwave available. There is no switch off button for the light in the bedroom next to the bed."

594,"Beautiful new hotel. Location is fairly isolated, though."
595,"Great hotel. Staying in a 1 BE apartment long term. Very new facility. Very nice coffee shop with great food and service.

619,"The environment of the hotel is very good, the location is located in the new city, and there are few supporting facilities around, but it is not a problem to eat. The facilities in the room are equivalent to the level of domestic express hotels. The front desk can speak English and can communicate. Generally speaking, Vietnam's five-star is equivalent to domestic The three-star class is less than four-star, and the price is about the same"
620,The room smells
621,"Hotel room is not bad. Breakfast is okay, but there is no restaurant in the hotel, so you have to go to nearby Japanese, Chinese, or Vietnamese restaurants. There didn't seem to be any places to shop nearby, and it's a location I don't want to stay for a long time."

But hotel location is great for the business around this new industrial area"
643,"I was blown away by this hotel.  First off, it is very beautifully-designed throughout.  The staff goes above and beyond to make guests feel special.  Check-in was hassle-free.  The apartment hotel was extremely clean with a comfortable bed and a nice view.  The area is so quite and peaceful.  The gym and infinity pool at night especially are so relaxing.  The highlight of my trip was the restaurant which has great service and the best Western food and cocktails in the area.  I would love to stay here again!"
644,"clean, hygienic and comfortable"
645,"Belongs to the new urban area, the hotel environment is very good"

653,"Good facilities, quiet setting"
654,"Clean, $60 per night, breakfast included, best value for money"

The Stagg were also very friendly and spoke very good English."
656,Fantastic hotel and staff. Food variety less

662,Nice service
663,"Peaceful, clean, beautiful view"
664,"The environment is good, but there is no food around!"
665,"I have mixed feelings with this Becamex. Same time last year, i stayed at this hotel, although there were no pool and gym available and i got their words that they were under construction, i had a great time and put 5 star rating for this hotel with all hospitality i got from hotel staff. For this recent stays, pool and gym are not still in operation (although the next door serviced apartment (owned by Becamex hotel/group) pool and gym are vacant but not accessible by hotel guests) which is not acceptable for 4 star hotel in the remote location, the hospitality of reception desk staff has gone to the new low, they seems not be able to handle simple requests from customers. The room clearness is ok (that is some you expect from 4 star hotel so nothing fancy here). The only highlight I got from this stay is the wonderful services from restaurants staff."
666,"It's just suitable for business trips, it's too far away and there are no shopping malls around"
667,"Clean and quiet as always.
More food choices this time round..."
668,"Delicious bearkfast.
Inconvenient surrounding environment"
669,Friendly staff
670,CHECK OUT time is too long and it takes 30 minutes. It seriously affects our scheduled travel time.
671,"Stayed one night, including breakfast.
Rooms clean and spacious. Staff were ok. Amenieties, well there are none. Quite remote location but a few restaurants close by. All ok except breakfast. Tea and coffee were served from communal pots, but the tea was awful so I asked for some boiling water and a tea bag but was refused. Spoke to the duty manager at the restaurant and asked him to try the tea and he agreed it was terrible but that's the way they do it. Offered to let me have a tea bag at extra charge! Nice when I've paid for breakfast and all I wanted was a cup of tea, nothing else.
It's the first time I've ever left a hotel restaurant to go to a coffee shop to get a cup of tea
I know this is a very small complaint, but a bit of common sense and I would have been quite happy, instead  I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone either."
672,"It's quiet for sleeping on a business trip alone, and the room condition is good for the price. However, it is correct to see that there is nothing inside and outside. Meals and transportation are very inconvenient."
673,"I didn’t like the hard bed , the air conditioner not adjustable, too warm."
674,It's the best. Facilities and friendliness
675,Clean and quiet.
676,"This is my second stay. In 2016, a new hotel was opened in Thu Dau Mot New Town, close to Binh Duong Industrial Zone. The facilities are very new! The environment is quiet and the service is very good! Continue to book in the future!"
677,"Overall, I feel safe and comfortable staying in this hotel. Staffs are very friendly and helpful. They can communicate in English. Nevertheless, I would prefer and like to try more local delights since I am a foreigner. Most of the foods served here are western foods."
678,"This so-called hotel feels more like a real estate sales promotion. Its format is basically a small residential unit with a sofa, dining table and kitchen. The business guests are very small, but I met many Korean women who came to play golf. The buffet breakfast is very rich and lively, but I am the only one eating in the evening. The hotel has a swimming pool and spa, but it has been open for three years and has not yet been used. The location is really remote, if there are vacancies, it is better to live in the Becamex Hotel near the city center!"
679,"Stayed alone in this hotel for 3 different nights to get some good rest from weekday hard work. 

Clean, great services, people nice, but no swimming pool or gym even outside nearby was very disappointed for me. However, it was good to have time to get refresh. 

Used three different rooms, two was with good view and quite, but one was terrible sleep with noisy from neighbor’s room. 

Think.... it is good for business trip that I recommend."
680,"All five points must be given, all aspects are good, the sense of luxury is acceptable, recommended! !"
681,poor service
682,"The hotel is quite large, next to Binh Duong province's convention and exhibition center"
683,"
BECAMEX is the second best hotel in this area. New enough, the front desk said that the swimming pool is under construction. It is OK for more than 300 yuan. The location is 20 minutes away from the city center. There is a bar in the vicinity of 3 minutes, and there is convenience in 10 minutes Shop. Nearby is a high-end residential area, many facilities are under construction. I believe there will be a new scene in the future. The breakfast is too small to choose. The orange juice is not fresh. Basically, I can’t think of anything delicious. Let’s order a cup of Vietnamese coffee....Basic It's clean and has an electric toilet. But because it's too far away, you don't have to think about anything, just hibernate obediently at night...."
684,"The environment is fresh, clean and tidy. The staff try their best to keep it clean and beautiful. Thank you very much for the long-stay rooms. The layout is very warm. I think it's nice, but there is a swimming pool and a gym, but they can't use it. They claim that the facilities have not been completed. Waiting to live here for almost a year, but it's been a long time. It's very disappointing to start half a project. I also want to suggest that your hotel has such a large scale and space. You can build a children's play area, so that business people or tourists who have children living here for a long time can feel more at ease with their children here. pleasure"
685,"Clean. It's quiet because it's in an industrial area, but there's no convenience store nearby, so convenience doesn't seem to be good."
686,5 star standard hotel
687,Good foods and lovely environment
688,Quiet place with good ratio price/service
689,Nice place. Good hotel. Nice construction . Calm and quiet.
690,"This is the best hotel in this neighborhood, but there are not many facilities around it, so it is inconvenient for eating and shopping."
691,"A five-star hotel costs about NT$1,600 a night."
692,This is a place with a clean environment and good traffic
693,"5 star hotel whit a very good price, but  pool and spa not yet ready"
694,Everything is beautiful except the language barrier
695,Quiet... Good service...
696,"Good service, cheap price"
697,"Excellent hotel for the price, but there is no place to eat nearby. Hotel meals are also good."
698,Nice and spacious space. Worthy in Binh Duong New City area
699,Inexpensive and clean environment Breakfast is so-so
700,Beautiful Staff is extremely attentive and enthusiastic. Delicious breakfast. Other dishes: a bit expensive (Pho Bo 100k/bowl). Good service.
701,Room is ok but other facilities are not ready to serve. Boring around.
702,"Shampoo has three Aedes mosquitoes, disgusting."
703,Great experience in Becamex
704,"good quality hotel , not near anything , no soul."
705,"Recommend the regular room type (as opposed to Service Apartment) which has the more regular ""hotel"" feel of traveling."
706,"They were out of regular room for the first night so I tried their Serviced Apartment room type.
Spacious and the bed room is a separate room. Too bad that the bed room do not have TV, where I use it to hypnotize myself into sleep when traveling.
There is a small balcony which is nice, BUT BE VERY CAREFUL that sliding door do not have handle on the outside, so when you slide it close once you are outside, there is no where you can get back in...Unless you have phone and can call the front desk to the rescue."
707,"I'm staying for more than 2 months on a business trip.
1. Room: clean (good value for money)
2. Additional facilities: No swimming pool, gym, business lounge, etc.
3. Service: friendly and good
4. Meals: 2 months of struggle with repeated breakfast
5. Surroundings: There are only a few restaurants due to lack of infrastructure
(There is one Korean restaurant, the taste is...)
6. There is a convenience store nearby, so there are Korean cup noodles, kimchi, and snacks.
7. Tourism and Amenities: There is a paid swimming pool, health & yoga, tennis court, badminton court, etc. 1.5km away
(800,000 VND for 1 month of gym <About 40,000 won>)"
708,"Breakfast menu is too meager for the size of the hotel.
Room service menu too small."
709,"Can not use swimming pool, very disappointed"
710,"Close to industry park, and that's the only thing it is convenient for.
Hotel is relatively new and clean however, keep in mind it location is the new district with nothing around."
711,The toilet still has hair from the previous tenant
712,"1st time to this hotel and is well managed 3-year hotel. big room, clean and competitive price.. planning to have business meeting or seminar for the customers nearby!!! keep it up"
713,"It's new, so it's clean and has good security, but the facilities are still weak and there's almost nothing around. There are many people who do business on business trips, but there is no shuttle, so it is not recommended for families."
714,"It's a new hotel, so everything was clean and nice."
715,"Clean and quiet.
Breakfast is not so good"
716,"it's definitely isolated area from city but it's new and clean, i'm not sure what their star rate is but it was absolutely outstanding for their room charge.
spacious with very attentive staffs, good cafeteria, tennis court and i liked the structure with empty center hallway.
there is a swimming pool but it belongs to the apartment area when i went to have a look the security stopped me. i'm not sure it is only for apartment residents."
717,"I sprained my ankle on a business trip on November 13th, and came directly to my room with a wheelchair from the hotel. I also received a note saying to contact me immediately if there are any problems with printed materials translated into Korean as I do not speak English or Vietnamese. I was so grateful for the meticulous consideration, and when I said I liked the hotel, other business travelers using it increased. The only regret is that when I go on a business trip, I stay for 4 to 7 days, but there is no breakfast that suits the taste of Koreans, and I tend to get bored with the unchanged breakfast. It's a cheap accommodation, but I think the breakfast needs a little change."
718,"The hotel is new and clean, but far from residential areas, so it is suitable for those who want to be quiet and rest after a working day."
719,"Really good breakfast with a variety of Western and Asian food. Rooms are comfortable, modern, and well equiped. When it comes to the service quality, the standard is comparable to European 4 star hotels."
720,"Good, affordable, next time you want to live"
721,"Rooms and lobby are spacious, clean and comfortable.
nothing especially"
722,"Breakfast was fine.
The last time I came here was a year ago. At that time, it was said that the swimming pool and gym were being repaired. A year later and still nothing. "
723,"The hotel as a whole: the room, the staff and the location from the object that I needed. The purpose of the trip was business. I would like to note the hotel staff, namely the competence, responsiveness, friendliness and attention to the guests of the hotel. I really liked the hotel itself, so the length of stay amounted from November 3, 2017 to November 18, 2017.
Pricing policy for the airport-hotel"" transfer: this service is provided, but the cost is 2.5 times higher than taking a taxi (I note this not as a drawback, but as a circumstance that can be improved)"""
724,"Room space.
Breakfast too little"
725,"The room booked on Ctrip for a business trip is the standard of a five-star hotel and the price of a three-star hotel! It's a pity that the Chinese service needs to be improved! It is difficult to communicate without a translator. The breakfast environment and dishes are not bad, the bed is very comfortable, and the hotel uses a very good mattress! I hope there are Chinese prompts on the TV and facilities in the room, and I will stay in this hotel next time I come to Vietnam!"
726,Warm toilet seat
727,"Clean, hygienic, comfortable and warm, the location is a bit remote, but fortunately there are taxis scheduled at the door, the breakfast is very delicious, the surrounding environment is quiet, there are Chinese restaurants, Japanese food and convenience stores diagonally opposite, overall I am very satisfied, it is worth recommending!"
728,"The location is not very central, but it's not very remote either.. A very good hotel for a business hotel.."
729,QUIET ENVIRONMENT WITH SOME NICE RESTAURANTS NEARBY
730,"It's a new hotel, so the price is good for the standard, but there's nothing around and nothing in the hotel is properly operated except for the breakfast buffet."
731,"Hotel staff are very nice, rooms are clean and comfortable, everything was fine for me."
732,"It's a place I went on a business trip, but the surroundings are not active, so there are few places to eat or enjoy nearby. I can't even use the facilities. It's new, so it's clean, but it's still not recommended for families."
733,"The room was spacious, comfortable and clean"
734,Good service and convenient place to rest.
735,"Clearly.
Location"
736,"This is the New Town Becamex.  It is next to a convention center but it is out in the middle of no where.  They have really good food, and the cost wasn't bad.  The staff is good.  No place to go  around there, so really it is just either for business or a get away for R&R."
737,"Rooms are spacious, new and clean!
nothing especially"
738,"Location is far from city centre, not convinece for business traveller."
739,"The breakfast is average, the sanitation is good, the facilities are good, and the place is a bit biased"
740,"The room was spacious, clean and comfortable!
The view from the room was also good.
Room confirmation time at check-out is a little late. "
741,"Excellent environment.
No place for leisure activities around"
742,"Very new hotel with clean and spacious rooms. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Great place to stay in Thu Dau Mot. I did enjoy my stay. Definitely recommend it.
Breakfast is just so-so."
743,"Peripheral accessories, software executive director"
744,Clean and relatively new hotel. Great staff but location is in the new developing area so nothing much to see
745,environment of grace
746,"It's clean, the breakfast is good, and it's very good."
747,Good option for business traveler
748,"It's worth the money, and will consider it in the next trip"
749,Smokers are better outside!
750,"There are no amenities near Becamex yet, so my time was free. I wanted to run a coffee shop until late and make it like a little bar. I wanted to get a massage, but that was also disappointing. If that part is met, I would like to recommend more. ."
751,"The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The view from the room was also good. You can watch Japanese NHK TV, and it was easy to get information. Nothing in particular."
752,"clean.
Swimming pool and sauna unfinished"
753,"Breakfast and bed were comfortable....
Pool not open, no saunna"
754,"Relatively new hotel at the industry area.
Limited food choice after hour though"
755,Hygienic
756,The washroom has an automatic toilet seat which is really nice
757,The hotel is located in the new urban area. The decoration is luxurious. The room is very comfortable. The wifi is very powerful and very good.
758,Hot and cold water in the shower
759,"Located in a very desolate area
Do not allow visitors to enter the room late at night. 12 o'clock at night
A friend of mine came to visit..."
760,"New hotel at new city center so nothing much around the area.
Friendly and helpful staff"
761,Clean and comfortable for business traveler
762,New hotel and clean but choices of restaurant in the area is limited
763,"As a new business hotel, it shows great value for money. Compared to the existing Binh Duong Becamex Hotel, it has significantly better facilities and sanitary conditions. However, compared to the Becamex Hotel, the location is a bit far from the industrial area of Binh Duong. There is no facility nearby. There is not much floating population. Breakfast is not listed separately, but a simple meal is served in the room, and they say that you have to pay extra to use the outside buffet. Basically, it's a hotel breakfast. Ham naturally thought of serving a buffet, so this part felt a bit unpleasant.”"
764,"Breakfast is average.
The wash basin cannot be used after the toilet door is opened"
765,"The hotel itself is very good, but the surrounding area is really too far away. Going out alone at night is really scary."
766,I was forced to pay for small broken mirror even tough I did not touched the mirrow. Very bad experience.
767,"The hotel itself is very clean and comfortable. The rooms are luxurious. It is ideal for business travelers who work nearby and want to work in peace in the evenings or relax in the large hotel room. The bus network is well developed, punctual, cheap and reliable. The hotel is located in the ""New Town"" (Thanh Pho Moi) of Binh Duong. The city consists of modern high-rise buildings and huge streets. However, everything seems like a ghost town with no people. In the near and far area is as good as nothing going on. There are a handful of restaurants that are almost empty apart from one good sushi place. Street kitchens are non-existent. There is absolutely nothing in the hotel apart from the hotel cafe and hotel bar restaurant. Spa area, pool and fitness center are ""under construction""."
768,"The entire hotel and rooms were clean and spacious, and the facilities were good. The breakfast was good, and the service was good. It took a long time to check out (5-10 minutes), and I couldn't understand Japanese. , English is hard to understand"
769,"I wish the breakfast was a little better.
There was nothing around the hotel, so I was at a loss."
770,"The charging socket is the same as that used in China, and all the facilities are complete, which is very good. There are several restaurants around, not too expensive and acceptable."
771,As I travel for business this new hotel is great. Away from all the hustle bustle and beeping horns :)  Would not suite anyone on holidays as in a commercial area. But certainly my stopover hotel when visiting my suppliers in Ho Chi Minh.
772,"Stay four night in this hotel. Very close to Nam Tan Uyen Industrial Park. Nice coffee shop around the hotel corner. New, comfortable and clean. but gym is not yet opened. Very quite but nothing to do at night."
773,"Due to some problems, I had to cancel my booking through agoda on the day of pick up, the hotel gave me the flexibility to change the date without charge. New, beautiful, clean hotel, modern facilities, enthusiastic attentive staff, free breakfast and delicious lunch, reasonable price. Suggest the hotel to quickly complete the swimming pool and gym."
774,"One day there was no room and it was confiscated.
The deposit has not been returned to me due to computer problems. "
775,"Although VSIP Singapore Industrial Park is not far from downtown Ho Chi Minh City, it is a developing area with inconvenient transportation and accommodation is also a problem. The Becamex Hotel, operated by the industrial park in cooperation with the government, provides a comfortable and convenient option. The location is at the border of VSIP, and the hardware and software are very suitable."
776,"They need to hire a decent chef that knows  how to cook a steak. Dinner here was not so good and we waited and hour to get one of two meals which was a sea bass that came out overdone and fishy smell. Will not be back to this place .

They have a nice pool but it hasn't opened since the hotel was started so I don't stay here anymore.  

Hotel is poorly run and government owned."
777,The hotel is new and clean. But location is near industrial zone so limited choice of restaurant.
778,The location does not allow many choice of restaurant after hours.
779,It's just that the surrounding environment is not good and it's too far away. Others 0k
780,"I stay only 4 nights in this hotel but everything was perfect.
Everything is clean
The staff is friendly 
The standard room is big enough and cost around 50 € per night incl. Breakfast.

The only negative thing is,
You have nothing around the hotel
Only 1 small supermarket
3 restaurants i think.

So you have to go by taxi in the city or rental car.

Sorry for my bad englisch :D"
781,"Price is cheaper than Becamex downtown
There are no facilities inside
First of all, the cafe coffee on the first floor is cheap and delicious.
And if you go back 5 minutes from the hotel, there are so many restaurants where you can eat Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Western food.
There are a lot of Western food at the food court, and Korean ramen and other things are sold at convenience stores.
It's just that eating the same breakfast is boring."
782,"Very good hotel, attentive service"
783,pool not open
784,"Cheaper than Becamex downtown
There are so many auxiliary facilities, and if you go a little to the left from the entrance, there is a restaurant village right away, but there is no restaurant without Japanese, local, Korean, or Western food. It's just too far from downtown..."
785,"It's a new hotel near industrial zone so not much of a choice of dinner after hour.
Room is clean and spacious however, the staff still require more training to be a true 4stars service"
786,"It's really good, the value is moderate, and the room facilities are very good. Butt-flushing toilets are fun."
787,The environment of the cafe next to the lobby is good
788,"Pros:
  - Friendly and enthusiastic worker
  - clean hotel, modern design
  - the passion affair cocktail is delicious and cheap (compared to the price at a bar in the city)
Cons:
  - no gym, swimming pool, or tennis court
  - The space around Binh Duong new city is also nothing
     --> staying more than 2 days will be very boring"
789,"Dedicated service, luxurious interior"
790,modern appearance with good services
791,Eti's le coffee & pastry I think pastry and cake of this cafe is the best in Binh Duong. And Coffee is good also. But I feel little burn taste  because they use much Vietnamese beans I guess.
792,The best hotel in Binh Duong
793,Really nice hotel to stay in.
794,"A hotel that has a swimming pool but is not operating. But good value for money. Breakfast has not changed for 3 months. In the evening, the hotel bar is also closed. I hope to have it all up and running someday."
795,"Worth a visit, good security, happy staff"
796,"The staff require more experience and training, but as for the price and the cleanness of the hotel, this is a great hotel.
Location is near new industry zone, so nothing much to see or dine after hours."
797,Newest Becamex hotel in Binh DUONG New City. Soft opened. Very comfortable and cosy rooms. Good hotel facilities and recently opened coffee shop in hotel lobby. Will be the preferred hotel in this developing city.
798,"Location is remote, others are good"
799,"Hotel is new and rooms are clean.
The service and staff are also excellent. Arrangements for taxis to sudden destinations were made without delay. However, there are few commercial facilities around, and although there are several restaurants and a food court, it is not lively except for the sushi bar, and it is hesitant to enter. There seems to be a bus, so access to the city may be good. "
800,The best hotel I have stayed in Binh Duong.
801,"The hotel is very new, opened in 2016. The location is not in the city center, a bit remote, but the environment is relatively quiet.
There are swimming pools and tennis courts. If you don't like busy areas, this hotel is suitable for people who are busy and quiet
The price/performance ratio is also high, it is worth recommending! "
802,"Because it is a new urban area, the transportation is not very convenient, the hotel has just opened, the swimming pool and the gym are not perfect, so there is a discount, overall it is good, quiet, and the end."
803,"This hotel is very good, I stayed several times"
804,This hotel is very good
805,This hotel is very good in BD
806,"The hotel is new and clean
However the location is at centre of new development
so nothing much to see dinning option is limited"
807,"Hotel is clean, staff friendly just the gym & swimming pool is not available. I wish to do some workup during stay for 2 night but both gym & swimming pool not available."
808,Toilet hot water seens like not hot enough.Can be improve.
809,"It's wonderful because it conveys Japanese hospitality.
I can stay without complaining.
Not good for sightseeing, but…"
810,"The hotel facilities are great, service staff are excellent, best experience ever."
811,"I stayed for 28 days on a business trip, but it's okay, good good good"
812,"The hotel is clean, new and quiet. Good breakfast! There are beautiful swimming pools, tennis courts, squares around the hotel, which are very suitable for running, and there are several football fields opposite the hotel. It's a bit remote, not convenient for shopping."
813,"I used it for the first time.

The front desk and doorman can speak English.
You can't expect Japanese.

It's a new hotel, so it's very clean.

The housekeeper greets you with a smile
gave me

For breakfast, selectable card menu
I'll have a look and tell the staff.
(For some reason, there was also a buffet style day.)

Since it is a city that is developing from now on, there are few users.

There is a Japanese restaurant SUSHI BAR"" nearby, There was a convenience store ""Family mart"". """
814,Newly open and very good!
815,"The hotel is out of town and is really in a very secluded area but very convenient for those who are around the Binh Duong Convention Centre. Super new, friendly staff and good food :) 5* to this!"
816,Nice place but don't have many place to entertainment nearby
