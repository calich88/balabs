Review
"This hotel was introduced by a friend as the best hotel in the area, but I was a little disappointed after checking in. First of all, I arrived in the morning. The hotel did not allow early check-in on the grounds that there was no vacant room. When I returned to the hotel to check in at 6:30 in the afternoon Because I wanted a non-smoking room, check-in was delayed for at least half an hour. In the end, I got a twin room. In the apartment building, the air conditioner was very noisy, and the curtains in the room did not have sunshade function. Doesn't match..."
Better quality hotels in nearby areas
"The overall environment of the hotel is good, the breakfast is Chinese style, average, you can eat by the pool, but it is hotter, the room is an apartment-style suite this time, I personally feel that the distance is a bit suffocating, next time I will book an ordinary room ."
"This is the second time I choose to stay at Becamex Hotel New City, but my experience this time was really bad. At noon on the day I checked in, I arrived first, so I checked in first and informed the hotel reception that my friend would come in the evening. In the morning of the first day, we had breakfast together at the hotel restaurant, my friend was the one holding the room card to check the counter, the staff told the room there was only one guest, then they checked to confirm there were two. guest. See it as a temporary mistake that should have been fixed. On the second day, I had a meal and had the same situation. Why don't you double check the information? Hope my next experience isn't as bad?"

"Contains a hemorrhoid-free toilet, and the breakfast is diverse"
The rooms are getting older. Humidity on lower floors
"The room is big, the service is friendly, the breakfast is delicious, but the pillows are too soft. Although there are four pillows, none of them are comfortable to lie on. Overall, it is recommended"
"This hotel is located in the new city center, and the rooms are spacious and well-equipped, but there are few commercial facilities around.
It has been said for many years that it is a city that will develop from now on, but it seems that development has not progressed due to the influence of Covid-19.
Still, I have high hopes for future developments. "

"Worth continuing to stay, sanitation and breakfast are good"
"There is an important thing to say, the name of this hotel should be Becamex Hotel in Binh Duong New City. Especially when taking a taxi from the airport to the hotel, remember not to mention Thu Dau Mot, the driver will send you to the Bekamex Hotel in Thu Dau Mot. The hotel is comfortable"

Restaurant here having cuisine of Vietnam and other nations. Decoration great and good price. Service and taste also good. Highly recommend
"Nothing much nearby except for a Hikari. Room is spacious, will be better if they have bath tub"
Did not seem to change the pillow case?  Weird smell when you sleep on it. I would want to stay at the hotel section of the complex instead of the Apartment section next time.
Convenient in the center of the new city Close to Hikari in the restaurant area
The biggest and most luxurious hotel in the area. Professional working style
Very OK
"The honesty of the staff is doubtful. On 12/13 check out, I found that I forgot the money in the room that night, but the counter said that I couldn’t find it after searching for it 3 times. Will the money run away by itself? Or housekeeping? who knows? "
Convenient for factory visits but too far from HCMC. Service is cumbersome to an American but probably normal for Asia. Restaurant if FANTASTIC! Make sure you grab breakfast. Room was clean and modern. Great shower.
"The facilities are in place, especially the breakfast is recommended. It is a high-end business hotel"
"There are not many choices in the New city. The swimming pool is very good, the breakfast is rich, the sound insulation is very good, the location is very good, very convenient."

"Luxury hotel in Binh Duong New City of Becamex Group. The location is extremely convenient for customers to attend events - exhibitions in Binh Duong New City. The hotel is 5 star standard but only 4 star. With room types from low to high standards, VIP meeting room, Ballroom, swimming pool, Eit's cafe with green space and professional service staff. On the roof there is a tennis court, a large, open area overlooking the New City, suitable for Teambuilding activities. It also has an indoor or outdoor wedding reception hall.

The restaurant is also good. The restaurant is late-opening
Expensive price
"It is considered a relatively good hotel in Binh Duong. The hotel is just behind the government building. The front desk can speak Chinese, so there is no problem with basic communication. The air conditioner in the room needs to be turned on for a while to be effective... The sanitation is also good, and the price/performance ratio is okay... But it's not cheap here..."
This is a decent place to stay at for a business trip. It is quiet and reasonable.
"Luxury, good location, dedicated service, professional."

"Fast check in, friendly staffs with good command of English. Room is clean, and comfortable. Breakfast buffet has a good variety of food served. Only feedback is the location is far away from downtown and you will need to take a taxi for about 15mins (8km). For dinner, there is only 1 restaurant available on site"
"Good hotel, clean and good staff"
Best hotel in binh duong
"My colleague and I were here in this area for a business trip. And we are pretty happy to find this hotel in the area. The standards exceeded our expectation, the rooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast is pretty good as well. 
There are restaurants nearby, so the location is pretty good. Would stay again when we are back."

"Stayed and experienced it, it's very good"
Awesome property
My family often visit here
"The room was an apartment in a separate building from the front desk, and had a kitchen. There was a terrace in the room, and although it was on the 8th floor, there were no tall buildings around, so the view was good. Breakfast is a restaurant on the first floor across the pool, buffet style, noodles are pho and bunkang, eggs are cooked on the spot, such as omelets. There were many types of fruits, and when they ran out, they replenished different fruits. There is a free rental bicycle for up to 1 hour, and I was happy that my child could practice riding in a nearby park. There is a soba restaurant Katsu within walking distance around the hotel, and there are many Chinese restaurants, so you don't have to worry about eating. It takes about 15 minutes by motorbike to the Burnham theme park, the zoo is 150,000 VND for adults, 40,000 VND for children, and the athletics where parents and children can play was 100,000 VND for adults, 50,000 VND for children.There seems to be a pool, but this time Not used. The electric cars that move around the park are free, and it's a very large facility, so it's fun just to move around."
"It's a standard star-rated hotel. It's very comfortable overall. I've lived here for several years. A new Family Mart is opened on the first floor, which is even more convenient."
Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They even accorded us check out at 3pm. We are grateful for their kindness. Defintely return to stay whenever we are in Binh Duong city for business.
comfortable and good facilities

"Luxury, polite hotel"
"The room is comfortable and spacious and kept clean. The breakfast in the restaurant was very good, but the western food for dinner taste was far from menu. Whether it's a restaurant or a counter, getting an invoice is a hassle, especially for companies that have to print the name in English. The room is comfortable and spacious and kept clean.

"I visited for the first time in two years, and the area around the hotel has changed completely. Family Mart was made next to the cafe next to the lobby. Convenient. The room has a large refrigerator, kitchen and sink, so you can cook light meals. It is fully air-conditioned and cools well. Amenity is enriched, too and does not struggle. The bath is a room with a shower only. The bed is big and there is an air conditioner in the bedroom, so you can sleep well. There is a large TV, but it is not turned on. I will use it again."
