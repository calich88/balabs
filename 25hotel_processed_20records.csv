Manu P,"An amazing experience is what you will feel when you enter the hotel resort. Without doubt this is one of the most beautiful resorts in the world. And believe me I have seen a lot of resorts around the world. Rambagh management have definitely taken pains to restore most of the areas as a heritage property. The rooms are absolutely lavish and give you a feeling of royalty and the way maharajas must have been staying when they stayed here. The rooms have high ceilings and you surely get a feel of royalty. But they do I give the resort 3 stars and not 5. That is because when I think that I have paid around 600 usd for the room in Jaipur. Well I expect exceptional service, and amenities. But that is where the resort fails miserably. Examplesâ€¦ the food is served in grand silverâ€¦",amazing experience feel enter hotel resort doubt one beautiful resorts world believe seen lot resorts around world management definitely taken pains restore areas heritage property rooms absolutely lavish give feeling royalty way maharajas must staying stayed rooms high ceilings surely get feel royalty give resort stars think paid around room well expect exceptional service amenities resort fails miserably examples food served grand silver,3,,2023,India
dianedinky,"I know it is probably just me, but this dining experience was not one of my favourites.  Yes, the hotel and grounds are amazing, the dining room is lavish and everything smacks of money but, for me, it lacked any real atmosphere or charm. It was packed out the night we went so was very noisy and many children running about.  The staff had no time for any personal attention and the whole place had a vibe of 'look at how posh we are aren't you grateful to be here' as if they just were there to show off rather than serve you.  The food was also too posh for my tastes (my problem, I know) but it was a huge plates and tiny amount of food type of dinner which really annoys me! Glad I got to experience it but wouldn't recommend.",know probably dining experience one favourites yes hotel grounds amazing dining room lavish smacks money lacked real atmosphere charm packed night went noisy many children running staff time personal attention whole place vibe look posh grateful show rather serve food also posh tastes problem know huge plates tiny amount food type dinner really annoys glad got experience recommend,3,,2022,United Kingdom
Quest771534,"The place is decent but not really a wow. A water bottle costs 300, which is 40 bucks outside, which was the only wow factor. The bottle was not left on the table, it was bought to the table and opened up without giving enough time to think. Very sly indeed.",place decent really wow water bottle costs bucks outside wow factor bottle left table bought table opened giving enough time think sly indeed,3,,2021,India
Jon L,"I think when it comes to paying these prices, one should not arrive to a filthy room. Mould around the shower and a dirty sink. Service was poor, waiting 25 minutes for a coffee in the morning and 50 minutes to get a G&T by the pool is not acceptable. Tea and coffee in the room- no milk, not topped up, which led to a journey of discovery of teas and the dwindled.   The hotel changed our room and gave us a free meal at the next hotel, although they forgot to mention it to the next hotel which caused some embarrassment at check out.  In short they need to lift their game and the Oberoi hotels are hugely superior.  We stayed at the Taj Lake which was excellent in comparison to Jaipur.",think comes paying prices one arrive filthy room mould around shower dirty sink service poor waiting minutes coffee morning minutes get pool acceptable tea coffee room milk topped led journey discovery teas dwindled hotel changed room gave free meal next hotel forgot mention next hotel caused embarrassment check short need lift game hotels hugely superior stayed lake excellent comparison,2,,2023,United Kingdom
Rimpal,Very poor services. According to the ratings your food quality and the services as promised were not up to the mark.even the food served was not hot. Overall experience was very bad. Air conditioners were also not working properly in banquet hall.,poor services according ratings food quality services promised food served hot overall experience bad air conditioners also working properly banquet hall,2,,2021,
Tej,"We were disappointed with the overall management of the wedding. There were cleanliness issues, lack of communication, non-availability of staff and filthy washrooms.  The hospitality was not as per expectation and we weren't happy guests at the hotel.In conparison to our subsequent stay at Jai Mahal, the services at Rambagh were lukewarm.    For someone getting married at Rambagh, we were hoping for more; especially when you splurge so much for a once in a lifetime experience.",disappointed overall management wedding cleanliness issues lack communication staff filthy washrooms hospitality expectation happy guests subsequent stay services lukewarm someone getting married hoping especially splurge much lifetime experience,2,,2020,

Farhan M,"I have ate at Michelin starred reviews around the world. I was looking forward to dining here as the highlight of my trip.Sadly my experience didnâ€™t really meet the standards that I expected. I was served by Ruksar sukhlal Aidan and Manpreet. When asked about the menu they didnâ€™t seem to have much knowledge and didnâ€™t really recommend anything. I also feel like I was judged because of my age, and wasnâ€™t provided the level of service that I expected.",ate starred reviews around world looking forward dining highlight experience really meet standards expected served asked menu seem much knowledge really recommend also feel like judged age provided level service expected,1,,2023,
Tarunjit B,"We were staying at Sawai Man Mahal and decided to have dinner at the back lawn of Ram Bagh Palace where classical as well folk dances as well as instrumental music is played.   We got there at 7 pm - 30 minutes before the musical program was to begin. We were a part of 3 (including my two grown up kids). There was a table of four next to performance area and it was empty with no sign on it. As we were about to sit down, one of the hotel staff came running and said stop quite loudly. I asked why and he said that this table was just reserved by some guests who had gone inside to get a drink and would be out momentarily. We then gladly took the only table available at the farthest end of lawn from where the performers could hardly be seen.  We ordered drinks and food.

Al,Beautiful setting and the couples therapy room was outstanding. But from the get go I felt very rushed. When someone comes to a spa .. you want to relax a bit.

K S R,Property is beautiful and staff very polite and helpful.  Service is excellent and so is the food. SMM hotel has opened in the same premises. This has created problems as all their guests can use all these facilities at Rambagh Palace. The charges there are less than half of RBP and naturally they prefer the option of dining at RBP.. This usually creates situation of lack of space in restaurants for guests of RBP as also non residents have been allowed. Another factor was that for New Year eve dinner RBP and SMM guests were combined and the rates were steep for  RBP and not for SMM. It was unfair for RBP guests who have always enjoyed New Years Eve exclusively.   Quality of food was excellent and the Chefs team are really great as also the service at the restaurants and roomâ€¦,property beautiful staff polite helpful service excellent food hotel opened premises created problems guests use facilities palace charges less half naturally prefer option dining usually creates situation lack space restaurants guests also non residents allowed another factor new year eve dinner guests combined rates steep unfair guests always enjoyed new years eve exclusively quality food excellent chefs team really great also service restaurants room,4,,2022,
Wai Ting H,"Nice ambience at the Verandah to spend a relaxing afternoon. My husband had the Indian high tea set and I had the English Victorian. The Indian one is more tasty. Tea is included too.  I asked for no cheese and the chef Asmok and service staff Sarjeet came to check if I would like my high tea dairy free.
